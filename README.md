# TL;DR

`pWSGI` is a WSGI wrapper with `pulsar`. It can easily map a wsgi app (such as
`Flask app` or `djang app`) to a `pulsar wsgi app` with full features supporting by `pulsar`.

# How To Use

* Basic

```
usage: pwsgi [-h]

pWsgi - a pulsar based async wsgi implentation 0.1

optional arguments:
  -a APP, --app APP     path of wsgi app, required
  -w WORK_PATH, --work_path WORK_PATH
                        work path of wsgi app [default: ./wsgiapp.py]

```
* Run as pulsar wsgi

```
